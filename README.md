# VisionTransformer
Code for UMC203 project

The codes outside final folder are taken from  and have not been used in the final models trained the final model trained are inside the folder final

There some sample images from mnist and cifar are named as 1.png 2.png ... 10.png and there are python files with those model structure defined in them for both Simple vit and SWIN transformer

Running these .py file will load the model which are trained on these dataset and saved in the folder as .pth file with there parameters and will predict the images using the model

In the training part we have added the code used for training these model and also except for VIT cifar we have also added the trained model for each epoch in the folder also the ipynb file has the code on how these model were trained and how the parameters where taken please not that these code were trained using the help of google drive on which the dataset was uploaded to use this please download the CIFAR and MNIST data and save them in google as zip file then run these ipynb file in the google collab enviroment
